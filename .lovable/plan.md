# Revised Plan: Framework-Aligned Updates

## ✅ COMPLETED

All changes have been implemented:

### Part 1: Updated Existing TPs (Medium Gaps)

**TP-ECO-006** - Updated to avoid "flat no" approach:
- New talking point: "Don't refuse outright. Discuss cash flow needs first, then suggest bullet plan or custom schedule post management approval"
- Added guidance for structured alternatives

**TP-ECO-007** - Added competitor comparison requirement:
- New talking point: "Suggest lower floor/unit to cover deviation. DO FACE TO FACE with pre-approved strategy. Show what competition offers at similar deviations"
- Updated logical argument with competitor pricing comparison

---

### Part 2: Created New TPs (Zero Overlap)

**TP-DEC-006: Budget Discovery**
- Category: Decision Process
- Sub-category: Budget Discovery
- For leads who are "just started scouting" with unclear budget
- Talking point: Work backwards from family needs to budget range

**TP-DEC-007: Family Alignment**
- Category: Decision Process
- Sub-category: Family Alignment
- For family location disagreements (work commute vs established area)
- Talking point: Acknowledge both, show township addresses both needs

### Part 3: Created New NBAs (Zero Overlap)

**NBA-COM-014: Budget Discovery Consultation**
- Trigger: Just started scouting AND budget unclear
- Action: Conduct discovery call with structured guidance
- Linked to TP-DEC-006

**NBA-COM-015: Family Alignment Visit**
- Trigger: Family disagreement detected AND location objection
- Action: Schedule joint family visit, address concerns separately
- Linked to TP-DEC-007, TP-LOC-002

---

### Part 4: Keyword & Matrix Updates

**New Keywords Added to Decision Process:**
- Budget discovery: "scouting", "not sure budget", "don't know budget", "figuring out", "haven't decided"
- Family conflict: "wife wants", "husband wants", "spouse disagrees", "parents want different", "family conflict"

**Matrix Entries Added to All 13 Personas:**
- "Budget Not Clear (Scouting)": Maps to NBA-COM-014 + TP-DEC-006
- "Family Location Disagreement": Maps to NBA-COM-015 + TP-DEC-007 + TP-LOC-002
